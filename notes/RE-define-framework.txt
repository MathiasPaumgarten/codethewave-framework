Scarlet Pleasure

Requirements and Rules based on our meeting 22-08-2016


```

    Frontend:

        - The song will be divided in 10 to 12 sections

        - User should be able to select each section and then choose a visual style for that section.

        - A visual consists in a full-set creation for all 3 layers based on the data received from SPFramework.

        - Trouble/Molamil will decide what visual will be available for each section of the song.

        - Users cannot combine layers form different artists, only select a visual per section.

        - When users share on FB we should share an image of the current Visual from the current Section playing.

        - When interacting with sections and visuals we'll refresh the url deep linking to the current preselected style. Example: url.com?&section-1:visual_id&section-2:visual_id


    Framework:

        - Methods:

            - set:

                - debug: true or false

                - at: "back", "mid" or "fore" (layer id)

                - section: "s1" "s2" "s3"... (the section of the song the player should start playing first for testing)

                - tip: 140 max explanation on how to interact with this visual. Example: "Move your mouse or drag your finger around to create particles"

            - start:

                - section-id: id of the desired section to start the song from.

                This method should be called only after defining all 3 layers of the Visual.

                Once this method is called we'll start loading all assets added on load of each layer.

                We'll add a video to be previewed by the artist as a reference.

                We will add also a layer of branding and controls to navigate between sections so artists can preview their work with better context.

            - load: array of App assets by id

            - init

            - render

                - input:

                    // framework input

                    - input.container

                    - input.resolution

                    - input.textures

                    - input.graphics

                    - input.colors

                    - input.isTouchDevice

                    -

                    // media input

                    - input.audio: WebAudioAnalyser instance (https://github.com/hughsk/web-audio-analyser)

                    // vtt input

                    - Pulse (Molamil)

                    - Off pulse (Molamil)

                    - Sections (Trouble)

                    - Frame-style (editing, cuts): full-band, detail, ... (Trouble)

                    - Cast: drummer, singer, bass, all (Molamil)

                    - Tracking (only one at the time) example: {x:1234, y:234, label:"head"} (Trouble)

            - resize

                - width: number

                - height: number

                - resolution:

            //  user input will be sent in the following methods

            - click

            - move:

                - position: {x:0, y:20} if is mobile this information should be send when you tap and drag your finger around.

            - tilt:

                - accel: {ax:0, ay:0}

        - Rules:

            - Artists should use CodePen as a main tool for coding and sharing their visuals using our SPFramework.

            - Artists can use other tools to code but once they are done they have to be pasted into CodePen to get a chance to feature the video.

            - Artists are free to create graphics and colors as they want but we'll encourage them to use the ones provided on the framework.

            - If a visual looks cool but we think it could look better with a few tweaks we will go ahead and change the visual forking their work in CodePen. Then we'll request their permission to use our forked version in the site.

            - Artists should informed the nature open source nature of their body work, so they should be open to share their code to be forked in the CodePen community.

            - A visual should always have at least a background (midground and foreground are possible but not mandatory)

            - Midground is the only layer than can be masked by the video, artists should be able to decide when and if this happens.


```









------------------------------------------------------



Framework:


    - Artists should have a fix canvas we scale or they should know about building a resizable experience?

        free resize

    - Can artists add their own graphics or only they are only allowed to use the ones we provide?

        yes. We should motivate them to use our graphics or colors.

        We could fork their work to match our style and then ask for their permission.

    - Can artists add their own colors or only the one provided?

        yes.

    - Background is always visible, correct?

        yes

    - Midground is always visible, correct?

        it depends on the artist


Frontend:

    - Can users choose when and how all 3 layers of visuals are combined?

        no. full sets.

    - What's the minimum amount of layers users can set? 1, 2 or 3?

        we decide based on the artist.


------------------------------------------------------


    System:

        - CodePen: Artist should share there and be open to share their code to be forked.

        - We decide what styles will be available for each Section (the time of the video).

        - We'll set around 10-12 Sections for changing visuals.

        - Share depth link with pre-selected style: url?&section-1:artist_id

        - Framework: Artists tip should be added so they can describe what user can do to interact with.


    Rules:

        - Midground is the only layer that can be masked by the video. Users can decide if and when is masked.

        - Foreground is always on top of everything.

        - Always a background

        - 1 style/artist at the time (all 3 layers)

        - User input in the framework:

                - Mouse position (on mobile requires tap and release)

                - Click or tap

                - Tilt for mobile/tablets


        - Framework input:

            - Color palettes

            - Graphics

            -  Patterns

            - Resolution

            - isMobile

            - Audio data

            - Video

            - VTT:

                - Off pulse (Molamil)

                - Sections (Trouble)

                - Frame-style (editing, cuts): full-band, detail, ... (Trouble)

                - Cast: drummer, singer, bass, all

                - Tracking (only one at the time) example: {x:1234, y:234, label:"head"}


            - CodePen branding:

                - Frame, Logo and Sections.


    Frontend:

        - One click to play around.

        - FB share: when users share we should get the current image to share.
